## About 

This is a proof of concept for a plug and play React component for credit card payments.
The component integrates directly with the web component of the payment provider and the backend payment service that handles the authorisation of the payment. 

The idea is the a front end app build with React can just import a fully functional component that handles the payments.
For the purpose of this POC the component is saved in the BB-Payment-Component folder.
